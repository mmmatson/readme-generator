  # README-Generator

  ## Description
  In this repository I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

  ## Installation
  1. Fork the repository so that you have a local copy saved on your computer.
  2. Navigate to the forked repository on your computer using your command line application.
  3. Enter 'node index.js' in the command line application to start the README generator.

  ## Usage
  ![README-generator video demo](assets/videos/demo-readme-generator.webm)

  Follow the instructions for installation to start the README generator. Answer the question in your command line application to populate different sections of the README file. Once you have answered all questions, a "sampleREADME.md" file will be generated in your forked repository.
